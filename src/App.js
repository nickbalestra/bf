          We got hitched in Muralto, Switzerland, on March 2nd ðŸ¤µðŸ‘°ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­

          Organizing an international wedding has been. . .challenging,
          especially since we still live on different continents! Once we
          complete the immigration process, we plan to celebrate in the U.S.
          with all of our loved ones. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve built this website: to
          share the story with you and to to keep you posted about the upcoming
          party ðŸŽ‰ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

          Since we have been blessed with all we need to be happy, we have
          decided not to create a wedding registry. We feel that being
          surrounded by the people we love the most is our greatest gift--thatâ€™s
          why we canâ€™t wait to start planning the party! However, for those of
          you who would like to send us a little something, we would love it if
          you considered making a charitable donation in lieu of a gift. Here
          are two causes close to our hearts, one in Switzerland and one in the
          US:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In Switzerland:
            <strong> Volontarie Vincenziane del Bellinzonese</strong>
            <br />
            CH-6500 Bellinzona. conto corr. postale : 65-4750-4 (CHF).
            <br />
            If you want to donate from abroad, let as know so we can help
            coordinate.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In US:
            <strong> Communities in Schools of Spokane, Rescue for All</strong>
            <br />
            If you want to donate from abroad, let as know so we can help
            coordinate.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ðŸ‘‰ Until we settle down together, you can send us card here: portland.
          <br />
          ðŸ‘‰ Stay tuned for the party.
          <br />
          ðŸ‘‰ Whatâ€™s up with the feet on our wedding announcement card?
