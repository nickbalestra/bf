          Organizing an international wedding ain't easy,
          especially when you live on different continents! Once we
          complete the immigration process we plan to celebrate in the U.S.
          with all of our loved ones. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve built this website: to
          share the story with you and to keep you posted about the upcoming
          party ðŸŽ‰ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

          Since we have been blessed with all we need to be happy, we
          decided not to create a wedding registry. We feel that being
          surrounded by the people we love the most is our greatest gift--thatâ€™s
          why we canâ€™t wait to start planning the party! However, for those of
          you who would like to send us a little something, we would love it if
          you considered making a charitable donation in lieu of a gift. Here
          are two causes close to our hearts, one in Switzerland and one in the
          US:

            <br />
            If you want to donate from abroad (i.e. not Europe), let as know so we can help
            coordinate.
